  a. Chrome
    * It's up to date with modern JavaScript features we'll use.
    * Has good develpoment tools.
    * React has a good plugin for it.

    * https://www.google.com/chrome/
  b. Atom
    * Free
    * Vibrant tools for React developers
    * One of those tools is Prettier, which I'll use so you don't have to suffer
      through watching me format code.
    * https://atom.io/
  c. React
    * reactjs.org
    * Link to codepen (Get Started)
